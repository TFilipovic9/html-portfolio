<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Theo Filipović, and I'm currently a Computer Engineering
  student at FERIT Osijek, specializing in hardware-software systems and
  development. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been fascinated by computers, video
  games, and technology in general — which naturally led me to pursue a career
  in the world of software development.
</p>

<p>
  So far, I’ve worked with C and C#, and I’ve also explored other tools and
  technologies throughout my studies. At university, I’ve had experience with
  SQL, MATLAB, and various lab environments, while on my own I've taken a deep
  dive into the Unity game engine. Currently, I’m enrolled in a full-stack web
  development course where I’ve already completed HTML and am now diving into
  CSS and JavaScript. I’m constantly expanding my skill set and looking forward
  to combining both front-end and back-end knowledge in real-world projects.
</p>

<p>
  Although I’ve mainly worked on smaller-scale projects so far, I’m highly
  motivated to gain practical experience. I’m especially passionate about game
  development, and hope to work on larger and more complex systems in the
  future. After graduation, I plan to join the tech industry and, eventually,
  challenge myself within a startup environment where I can grow and contribute
  meaningfully.
</p>

<p>
  Outside the world of coding, I have a strong connection to sports — I play
  football and also work as a youth football coach. This role has taught me
  teamwork, leadership, and the importance of discipline — qualities I bring
  into my technical work as well.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re looking for someone who’s eager to learn, highly motivated, and
  passionate about development — I’d love to connect!
